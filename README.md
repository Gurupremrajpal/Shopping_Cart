# Shopping_Cart
<br>
<p> The project is based on an Online Shopping cart that sells electronic items. There are two main roles who can perform operations on the website. First is the user who can add the products to his cart and further can select the required shipping details and product quantity before he completes his purchase transaction. Next there is a role set for the admin who can do everything that the user can do but additionally the admin can add a new product to the product list in the database, update the product information from the product list, delete a product from the product list, check for any users information in the user list, and also make a transaction of a product in the cart as a user. Additionally the user and admin have access to their profile pages while logged in and there is log out functionality to terminate the session. </p>
